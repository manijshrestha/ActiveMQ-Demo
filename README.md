ActiveMQ-Demo

This is a demo project that shows setting up an Active MQ
Sample abstracted from http://briansjavablog.blogspot.com/2012/09/spring-jms-tutorial-with-activemq.html

For this to work, you need to have ActiveMQ installed and setup with two Queues 

	inQueue - Where Messages are sent to for the Applicaiton to process.
	outQueue - Where Messages will be dropped by the Application.
